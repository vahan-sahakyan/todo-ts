## Description

Create a Todo list application with React. The application should allow users to add, delete, and update todo items. (The UI part is not very important)

## Requirements

- The application should have a form for adding new todo items. The form should have fields for the title, description, and deadline of the todo item.
- The application should display a list of all the todo items. Each item should display the title, description, and deadline of the todo item.
- The user should be able to delete a todo item by clicking a delete button next to the item.
- The user should be able to mark a todo item as complete by clicking a checkbox next to the item.
- The user should be able to edit a todo item by clicking an edit button next to the item.
- The user should be able to filter the list of todo items by completed and incomplete items.
- Todo items should not be lost after closing the page and opening it again.
- Add the ability to search the list of todo items by title. (OPTIONAL)

## Technologies or packages to use

- redux, redux-toolkit
- react-router-dom (optional)
- yup (optional)
- react-hook-form or formik (optional)
- typescript (optional)
- Additional libraries by your preference

## Important note:

#### pay attention to folder structure of the application, consider todo list as just one of the many features of a large application
